# Soundcheck

Let's see if you can hear a sound. Make sure the volume is at a comfortable level.
Copy the following expression to the MÃ©gra editor, place the cursor somewhere between the outer parenthesis,
and press "Ctrl+Return" to execute it !

```
(once (saw 440)) ;; <-- one-shot event, here a sawtooth sound event
```

If you hear something (a sawtooth sound at 440hz), great! If not, back to the user guide :)
