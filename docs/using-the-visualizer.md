# Using the Visualizer

When using Mégra, it often helps to see what is going on. That's what the Mégra Visualizer is for.

It's currently not integrated in Mégra, but a browser-based application written in JavaScript.

## Installation

Follow the instructions in the README here: [https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/megra-visualizer](https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/megra-visualizer)

## Usage

Start the visualizer from a terminal by navigating to the folder where you stored it and running `node megra_visualizer.js`.

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8081`.

In the Mégra editor, call `(connect-visualizer)`.

Now, if you create any sequence generator, you can inspect its structure in the visualizer. 

You can set the browser to fullscreen mode and place it side by side with the Mégra editor.
