# Arithmetic Events

Every numerical parameter has an associated set of arithmetic events (see tutorial chapter "Event-Arithmetic").

Thus, the `rate` parameters has `rate-mul` (multiplication), `rate-add` (addition), `rate-div` (division) and `rate-sub` (subtraction)
associated.

```lisp
(sx 'foo #t
	(pear (freq-mul 1.5) ;; transpose the incoming event stream a (pure) fifth up by multiplying frequency
		(nuc 'bar (saw 'a2))))
```

```lisp
(sx 'foo #t
	(pear (rate-div 2) ;; transpose the incoming event stream an octave down by dividing playback rate
		(nuc 'bar (violin 'a3 :sus 200))))
```

You can use the `:idx` parameter to select a specific type (as of 0.0.11, select the specific oscillator for `mosc` or 
the peak filter for sample events):

```lisp
;; only modify frequency of second oscillator
(sx 'ba #t 
	(pear (freq-mul 2 :idx 2)
		(nuc 'fa (mosc :osc1 'saw :osc2 'saw :freq1 100 :freq2 200))))
```

If no index is specified, the arithmetic event will be applied to all entities that support it:

```lisp
;; modify frequency of all oscillators
(sx 'ba #t 
	(pear (freq-mul 2)
		(nuc 'fa (mosc :osc1 'saw :osc2 'saw :freq1 100 :freq2 200))))
```

## Special Events and Shorthands

### Keys 

Specify lookup keys for samples, works with `add` and `sub`.

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t
  (pear
	:p 10 (keys-add 'ff) ;; with a chance of 10%, use a more restricted search
	(nuc 'tra (piano 'a3))))
```

### MIDI Notes


The functions `midi-mul`, `midi-add`, `midi-sub` and `midi-div` allow you to work
with midi notes (from `note` event) the same way you'd work with frequencies in MÃ©gra: 

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t
  (cmp
	(mapper to-piano)
	(pear :p 12 (midi-add 2) :p 12 (midi-sub 3))
	(nuc 'tra (note 44 4)) ;; midi note 44, quarter
  ))
```

---

### `random-sample` or `rands` - Pick a Random Sample Every Time

Pick a random sample every time:

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t
  (pear
	(rands) ;; pick a random bassdrum every time
	(nuc 'tra (bd))))
```

---

### `sample-number` or `sno` - Sample Number

Pick a sample by its position in the sample folder.

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t
  (cmp
	(loop 'tro (sno 1) (sno 2) (sno 3)) ;; loop over the first three samples in the folder
	(nuc 'tra (bd)))
)
```

### Transpose

The transpose event multiplies the incoming frequency or playback rate by half-tones (currently there's only equal-tempered tuning).

#### Syntax

`(transpose <half-tones>)` or `(tpo <half-tones>)`.

#### Example:

```lisp
(sx 'foo #t
	(pear (transpose 4) ;; transpose the incoming event stream a major third up
		(nuc 'bar (saw 'a2))))
		
(sx 'foo #t
	(pear (transpose 4) ;; works the same on sample events ...
		(nuc 'bar (violin 'a3 :sus 200))))
```
